== Known Gstreamer problems
 * No sound card detected: if this happens you're probably missing a GStreamer
   plugin for your sound system. If you're using ALSA then installing
   gstreamer0.10-alsa should fix it.

== Known installation problems
 * Your system may not have libkeybinder packaged, or may have it without the
   proper pkg-config file. You can find the libkeybinder source at
   http://github.com/engla/keybinder/tree/master/libkeybinder/
